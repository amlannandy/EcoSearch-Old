# EcoSearch
EcoSearch is a mobile-based platform for Flora and Fauna Classification, Storage and Visualization. 
It lets the user upload pictures of Animals, Plants or Insects with a GeoTag, run classifications on them and then store them. Later, the user can view these on a map with object path tracking enabled to view the biodiversity in his/her surrounding areas.
